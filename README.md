# Calculator
Simple school calculator project:  
>>While studying at Eastern Oregon University we were tasked with creating a simple calculator using a stack with python.  
This was very easy, but it had it's problems for instance being able to evaluate 3(9) or -(9)6 ect...  
I also wanted a calculator that would have an interface and even some fun stuff like button noises rather than just command line output.  
So I created a better calculator that could handle a better range of input using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
